It is the reason we should do this transformation.\n","\n","But take care, once we transform categorical to numbers we often get a scala of values like [1,2,3,4,5] (imagine that the original values were ['white, black, blue, grey, yellow]), the model could interprete it as a degree of importance, what is not necessarily true. To avoid misunderstanding we should apply one technique that is is often called “one-hot encoding”.\n","\n","The function get_dummies (Pandas) will help with that. It will return a column to each label, containing 0 or 1, 1 if that label exist for that row, 0 otherwise."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eXzHQVqXhgMW","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## 1.
